## Why?

Considering that the main QMK repo and VIAL's fork of it still only has the Keychron Q1v1 (ATmega32u4) and Q2 in `master`, while the PRs to add the Q3, Q5, Q6, and Q0 have a long way to go be added, I've decided to take matters into my own hands and decide to both, add every Q/V board that's currently out while also porting them to be used with VIAL. (I do plan on submitting PRs to add to the main vial-qmk repo once the Q/V boards are merged with `qmk:master`.)

This fork will consolidate all of the Q/V boards that are currently out along with all the different variants into one code base.
 
If you don't know what VIAL, VIA, or QMK even is, I have tried, to the best of my abililes, explain what the 3 are [here](WHATIS.md). 

# How To
If you're already caught up, please read the [HOW2COMPILE.md](HOW2COMPILE.md) file for instructions on how to use this code.
 
I encourage you to use this code as a basis to learn from, but do note that **this not endorsed by either Keychron, QMK, or VIAL.**
